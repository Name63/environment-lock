A python script to obtain a lock on some environment resource that is known to Consul.
Lock is acquired using Consul KV storage as per [Mastermatt/semaphore.py](https://gist.github.com/mastermatt/b570b0dbbdd2181cd3b8d991b1bcecff) and [Consul Semaphore](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/semaphore.html)

Special thanks to [Mastermatt](https://gist.github.com/mastermatt) for the sample.

# Disclaimer
This is not a 100% verified code, but rather a proof of concept. It is not expected to work as described, therefore it is NOT ready for production use
